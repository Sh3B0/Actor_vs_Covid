# Prolog_task
Implementing Backtracking Search and A* algorithm in SWI-PROLOG, for solving a maze-like task.  
- Assignment submission for Artifical Intelligence course  

## Testing
1. Load the Knowledge Base, i.e., `['backtracking.pl'].` or `['astar.pl'].` 
2. Query `test_bt.` for testing backtracking search, or `test_as.` for testing A* (no need to reload the KB for generating a new map, just rewrite the query).
