Implementing Backtracking Search and A* algorithm in SWI-PROLOG, for solving a maze-like task.  
- Assignment submission for Artifical Intelligence course  

## Testing
1. Run [swipl](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable)
2. Load the main Knowledge Base, i.e., `['main.pl'].` 
3. Query `test.` to generate a random map and run both algorithm for comparison  
    - No need to reload the KB for generating a new map, just rewrite the query.  
    - Instructions for custom maps are included as comments in the file `['main.pl'].`  
## Map legend:
- A - Actor  
- C - Covid  
- P - Protection (Mask/Doctor)
